# Airline Reservation System (Front-end and Back-end)
Airline reservation system that takes an input file containing: list of airports, distance between airports, and current flights between airports.
Running the code shows a console based GUI that allows the user to pick a source and destination airport. Then, they can see the valid itineraries that lead from source to dest.

I do not claim all this code as much of it was skeleton code provided by my professor.

# How to Run
Clone this repository, then build and run it using the commands in the README. How to navigate the GUI is also in the README.

***Note that this code requires a Unix environment, so use that, or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). I personally ran this on a Mac with no issues.***
